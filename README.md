Binary files reading, event size found - 217 bytes. Can't parse the headers. All work done is in `binaryFilesStructure.ipynb`.

Reading binary files as hex string and parsing it myself. Creating working class `Event`, which is able to successfully parse an event with given starting position. Looking for functions from some library to create more efficient code, if possible. All still in `binaryFilesStructure.ipynb`.
